pipeline for i-Tree Eco:

1. Data Collection: The i-Tree Eco application allows users to collect data on tree measurements and other relevant information using various methods. This can be done through web forms, mobile data collection systems using smartphones or tablets, or traditional paper sheets.
2. Data Processing: The collected tree measurements and field data are entered into the i-Tree Eco application. These data are then merged with local pre-processed hourly weather and air pollution concentration data.
3. Model Estimation: The i-Tree Eco model utilizes scientific equations and algorithms to estimate ecosystem services and structural characteristics of the urban or rural forest based on the collected data. The model calculates various outputs such as urban forest structure, pollution reduction, public health impacts, carbon storage, energy effects, avoided runoff, forecasting, bio-emissions, values, and potential pest impacts.
4. Automated Processing: The i-Tree Eco application includes a central computing engine that automates the processing of data and applies the scientific equations to generate estimates of the forest effects. This automated processing ensures consistent and reliable calculations of environmental and economic benefits.
5. Reports: After the model estimation is completed, i-Tree Eco provides summary reports that include charts, tables, and written reports. These reports present the estimated results of the ecosystem services and structural characteristics of the forest based on the input data and calculations performed by the model.
6. Forecasting (Optional): i-Tree Eco also offers a forecast module that can be run after the initial model results are generated. The forecast module uses structural estimates, environmental variables, species characteristics, growth and mortality rates to project future tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and crown size. Based on these projections, benefits such as pollution removal, carbon storage, and carbon sequestration can be estimated. Additional factors such as tree planting inputs, pest and disease impacts, and storm effects can also be modeled.
