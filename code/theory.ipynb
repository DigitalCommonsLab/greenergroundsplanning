    "# Explaining the spacial regression analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "In spatial regression analysis, it's important to account for the spatial relationships between the observations in the dataset. This is because observations that are close to each other in space may be more similar than observations that are far apart, and ignoring this spatial autocorrelation can lead to biased estimates and incorrect inferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to account for spatial autocorrelation is to use a spatial weights matrix, which quantifies the spatial relationships between the observations in the dataset. The spatial weights matrix is a square matrix with the same number of rows and columns as the number of observations in the dataset. Each element of the matrix represents the strength of the spatial relationship between two observations, and is typically a function of the distance between the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this specific case, the spatial weights matrix is calculated using the `DistanceBand` function from the `libpysal` library. The `DistanceBand` function creates a binary spatial weights matrix based on a distance threshold. Observations that are within the distance threshold are considered neighbors and are assigned a weight of 1, while observations that are farther apart are assigned a weight of 0. The `threshold` parameter is set to 100, which means that observations that are within 100 units of distance are considered neighbors. The `binary` parameter is set to `True`, which means that the spatial weights matrix is binary (i.e. only contains 1s and 0s)."

    "GitHub Copilot: There are several important values in the regression output that can help you understand the performance of the model and diagnose potential issues. Here are some of the most important values and what they can tell you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **R-squared**: The R-squared value measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. In this case, the R-squared value is 0.9470, which means that the independent variable(s) explain 94.7% of the variance in the dependent variable. A high R-squared value indicates a good fit between the model and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjusted R-squared**: The adjusted R-squared value is similar to the R-squared value, but takes into account the number of independent variables in the model. In this case, the adjusted R-squared value is 0.9468, which is slightly lower than the R-squared value due to the presence of one independent variable. A high adjusted R-squared value indicates a good fit between the model and the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F-statistic**: The F-statistic tests the overall significance of the model. In this case, the F-statistic is 4714.9452, with a very low p-value (2.148e-170), which indicates that the model is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coefficients**: The coefficients for the independent variables tell you how much the dependent variable changes for a one-unit increase in the independent variable, holding all other variables constant. In this case, there is one independent variable (var_1), and the coefficient is 1.7274674. This means that for a one-unit increase in var_1, the dependent variable increases by 1.7274674 units, holding all other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multicollinearity Condition Number**: The multicollinearity condition number measures the degree of multicollinearity in the model. A value greater than 30 indicates high multicollinearity, which can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. In this case, the condition number is 1.528, which is relatively low and indicates low multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test on Normality of Errors**: The Jarque-Bera test tests whether the residuals (i.e. the differences between the predicted and actual values) are normally distributed. In this case, the test statistic is very high (1131.545) with a very low p-value (0.0000), which indicates that the residuals are not normally distributed. This suggests that the model may not be capturing all of the relevant factors that affect the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diagnostics for Heteroskedasticity**: The Breusch-Pagan test and Koenker-Bassett test test for heteroskedasticity in the residuals. Heteroskedasticity occurs when the variance of the residuals is not constant across observations. In this case, both tests have very low p-values (0.0000), which indicates that there is significant evidence of heteroskedasticity in the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Diagnostics for Spatial Dependence**: The Lagrange Multiplier (lag) test and Robust LM (lag) test test for spatial autocorrelation in the residuals. Spatial autocorrelation occurs when the residuals are correlated with each other due to spatial relationships between the observations. In this case, both tests have p-values greater than 0.05, which indicates that there is no significant evidence of spatial autocorrelation in the residuals.\n"
